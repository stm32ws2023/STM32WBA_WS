# Introduction
## Dear Participant of STM32WBA Workshop,
<br>

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on how to prepare for the live version of the STM32WBA Workshop session. This step-by-step guide is designed to provide you with all the necessary information about the prerequisites, installation process, and links to materials that will be useful during the session.

In this guide, you will find detailed information about the required software and hardware, as well as a brief overview of the installation process. Additionally, we have included links to materials that will be helpful during the session.


In the appendix, you will find some basic information about the board that we will be using during the session, as well as useful information about the configuration and usage of the STM32CubeIDE.

# Installation process
- download **STM32CubeIDE** from [here](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
- Install **STM32CubeIDE** (if not yet done)
- download and install **STM32WBA Cube library** (if not done yet):
  - run **STM32CubeIDE**
  - go to `Help -> Manage Embedded Software Packages`
  - within package manager window find `STM32WBA`, unroll it and select newest available version ( in your case STM32WBA 1.1.0)
  - press `install now`
<br>
![H5_Lib_Install](./img/6.png)

<ainfo>
STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeIDE are using the same repository by default, so the installed STM32WBA Cube library will be visible in both tools.

# Verification process before the workshop
The purpose of this part is checking whether all software components are installed properly.
<br>
Additionally prepared test project can be a base for next hands-on parts during the workshop.

## **STM32CubeIDE and STM32WBA Cube library**
<br>

----

<br>
**Task definition**
<br>

- Using STM32CubeIDE
  - Enable SWD for debug
  - Disable TrustZone
  - Configure ICACHE (in any of available modes)
- Select and configure USART1
  - in asynchronous mode,
  - using default settings (115200bps, 8D, 1stop bit, no parity) 
  - on PA8/PB12 pins
<br>

----

<br>
## **Step1** - project creation and peripherals configuration
 - Run **STM32CubeIDE**
 - Specify workspace location (i.e. `C:\_Work\WBA_ex1`)

<br>
- Start new project using one of the below methods:
  - by selecting `File->New->STM32Project` 
  - by click on `Start new STM32 project` button
  <br>
  ![Workspace_start2](./img/New_prj_start_2.gif)
<br>
- switch to **Board Selector** tab
- select **NUCLEO-WBA52CG** board
- press `Next` button
- within STM32 Project window:
  - specify project name (i.e. `WBA_UART`)
  - keep **enable TrustZone** option unchecked
  - press `Finish` button
  - on question pop-up window "Initialize all peripherals with their default state?" press `No` button 
  - on question pop-up window "Switch to proper CubeIDE perspective?", if it is showed, press `Yes` button 
  - on worning pop-up window "Do you still want a code generation?", press `No` button 
  - on following information pop-up window, it was our decision did not generate code, press `OK` button 
  <br>
   ![Workspace_start3](./img/11.gif)
<br>
- Peripherals configuration: Pinout&Configuration tab
- **ICACHE configuration** (System Core group)
  - select either 1-way or 2-ways (we will not focus on performance within this workshop)
  <br>
  ![ICACHE configuration](./img/8.gif)
  <br>
- **USART1 configuration** (Connectivity group)
  - select Asynchronous mode
  - keep default settings in configuration:
    - Basic parameters: 115200bps, 8bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity
    - Pins assignment: PA8, PB12
    - no interrupts, no DMA usage
  <br>
    ![USART3 configuration](./img/9.gif)
<br>
- **Project settings**
  - select `Project Manager` tab
  - check project location (.ioc file)
  - check project name
<br>
   ![Project settings](./img/12.gif)
<br>
  - generate project by one of the ways:
    - by pressing "gear" icon
    - by select `Project->Generate Code`
    - by pressing **Alt+K**

----

<br>
## **Step2** - coding part (`main.c` file)
<br>
Define the buffer of bytes to be sent over **USART1** (`USER CODE PV` section):
<br>

```c
  uint8_t buffer[]={"Hello STM32WBA\r\n"};
```

<br>
Turn on **LED1_GREEN** (`USER CODE 2` section):
<br>

```c
    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LD1_GPIO_Port, LD1_Pin, 1);
```

<br>
Toggle **LED1_GREEN** (`USER CODE 3` section)
<br>
Toggle **LED2_YELLOW** 
<br>
Start transmit of the data over **USART3** using prepared buffer and ***polling*** method
<br>
Wait for 250 ms
<br>

```c
 HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LD1_GPIO_Port, LD1_Pin);
	  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LD2_GPIO_Port, LD2_Pin);
	  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LD3_GPIO_Port, LD3_Pin);
	  HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, buffer, 15, 200);
	  HAL_Delay(250);
```

<br>

<br>

----

<br>
## **Step 3** - build the project
- Build the project using `hammer` button or `Project->Built All` or **Ctrl+B**
<br>
![Project build](./img/31.gif)
<br>

<ainfo>
In case of neither errors nor warnings after this process, STM32CubeIDE and STM32WBA library are installed correctly.
</ainfo>
